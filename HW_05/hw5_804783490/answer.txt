A. The program doesn't use Pthread_join so that the main thread won't wait for
the peer thread to terminate before its own termination. Thus, after creating the peer thread, the main thread terminated before the thread function can be executed.

B. replace the exit(0) to Pthread_exit(NULL)

echo_cnt is thread_safe because it uses semaphore: P(&mutex) and V(&mutex) to protect the thread.
echo_cnt is not reentrant because in each execution, it increases byte_cnt by n, where byte_cnt is defined as a global variable in the header file.
